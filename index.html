   	<h2>Ludwig</h2>
   	<p>Ludwig was the first of many Healing Church hunters to come, many of whom were clerics. As it was, clerics transformed into the most hideous beasts.[1] <br>

Ludwig was a hunter affiliated with the Healing Church. Under Ludwig's leadership, the Healing Church gained its own core of hunters, led 
<br>
by Ludwig himself under the patronage of the Healing Church. Ludwig trained his hunters to be honorable Spartans, and even trained <br>ordinary Yharnamites as hunters, effectively uniting the populace and using it to combat the scourge.<br>

Ludwig wielded a mystical greatsword, that he himself discovered, which allowed him to channel the abyssal cosmos. Ludwig looked to the <br>sword and the tiny beings of light that surrounded it, for guidance, allowing Ludwig to empty his fears, even in the middle of a hunt.<br>

Despite seemingly being respected, Ludwig had his detractors, who appear to have disagreed with his methods and did not appreciate his <br>hunters. These detractors dismissed Ludwig as a beast-possessed degenerate, and Ludwig suffered much denigration at their hands.<br>

At some point, Ludwig succumbed to the bloodlust and mutated into a horrifying beast, a terrible cross between horse, wolf and man. He was
<br> trapped in Hunter's Nightmare, and completely lost himself to the blood. He resided in the Underground Corpse Pile where, by killing<br> countless beasts and hunters in his blind rage, created the blood river which flows through the Nightmare.<br></p>
